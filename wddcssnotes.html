our css theme is a patagonia theme. The rustic color scheme with dark powdered colors with a lessened opacity gives off a muted, subtly pleasing presentation. The color scheme came first and then we decided to make the site patagonia themed with an image. We floated the current days work and the prep work for the next day in separate boxes with borders and margins. This allows for the eyes to compartmentalize. To go further we added dotted lines around the different things to do (labs, prep work,). these lines are dark green so they dont attract too much of the eye but still gives a slight suggestion. we changed the font and color of the date as well to allow the eyes to associate the content and the date with differnet colors. This allows the brain to focus on what it needs to focus when it needs to. by floating the divs for the current and prep day boxes, we were able to put them at the top next to eachother and floated the past days below to allow more focs on the current things. We floated the header with the personal info and the navigation links to the right to allow for more balance because the div text was on the left. we did this to allow an easier navigation through links because most people are right handed so they will be attracted to the nav bar more if it is on the right.
